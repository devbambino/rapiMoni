## Description
RapiMoni is a DeFi BNPL platform on Base for Latin America. Collateralize USDC to unlock zero-interest MXNe microloans, funded by merchant fees and LP yield.

## Problem
Inflation and devaluation erode savings in LatAm. Small-ticket credit is scarce or high-interest, excluding many underbanked users.

## Solution
Interest-free microloans backed by USDC collateral, where merchants pay the fees. MXNe LPs earn yield, and idle collateral generates extra revenue via Aave/Compound.

## Mission
Empower underbanked communities with affordable, instant credit in local currencyâ€”no interest attached.

## Impact
- Democratizes LatAm access to credit  
- Shields savings from inflation  
- Creates yield opportunities for local liquidity providers  

## Roadmap
1. **Week 1**: Smart contract MVP, collateral vault & loan logic (Base Testnet)  
2. **Week 2**: Uniswap v4 pool integration & MXNe liquidity bootstrapping  
3. **Week 3**: Front-end launch, UX polish, hackathon submission  
4. **Post-Hackathon**: Security audit, Mainnet deployment, merchant partnerships
